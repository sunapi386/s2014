1. A description of how to operate your program, including the full
pathname of your executable filewhich we will download for testing.

2. A description of the structure of your program. We will judge your
program primarily on the basis of this description. Describe which
algorithms and data structures you used and why you chose them.
This description should include a list of unimplemented aspects of the
assignments, if any. Also, if you know of bugs in your implementation
describe them explicitly.

3. The location of all source code submitted for the assignment and a set
of MD5 hashes of each file. The code must remain unmodified after
submission until the assignments are returned.

4. A listing of all files submitted.

5. Answers to the following questions:
i. How do you know that your clock does not miss updates or lose
time?
ii. How long does the train hardware take to reply to a sensor query?
(Note: To answer these questions, you need to do some timings of the
performance of your polling loop.)
